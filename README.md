Chromecast-MultipleSessions-POC
===============================

This is a modified version of the "Hello World" chromecast demo app to show that it is possible to run multiple Chromecasts from a single device.

To run this app, you will need to have your own application id registered with Google (see https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/registration#RegisterApp) and add that to "chromehellotext.html."  You will also need to get the serial numbers of the Chromecasts you want to develp with and add them to your list of development devices (https://cast.google.com/publish/#/overview).

NOTE: If you don't already have any registered devices, be aware it can take several hours or more before you can begin testing this app with them.
